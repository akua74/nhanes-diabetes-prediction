# NHANES 2017–2018 Diabetes Prediction Project

This repository contains the complete, reproducible workflow for my Data Science project analyzing predictors of diabetes using the **NHANES 2017–2018** dataset.

The project includes:
- A deep description of the dataset  
- Six exploratory figures  
- Two modeling approaches discussed in class  
- A fully reproducible Docker + Makefile environment that generates a PDF report  

This repo is structured so graders can reproduce the entire analysis using:

```bash
git clone <repo>
docker build . -t nhanes-diabetes
docker run ...
make report.pdf
```

📊 Data Source
This project uses four NHANES public-use datasets from the 2017–2018 cycle:
```
DEMO_J.XPT — demographics
DIQ_J.XPT — diabetes questionnaire
BMX_J.XPT — body measurements (BMI, waist)
GHB_J.XPT — glycohemoglobin (HbA1c)
```

Download the datasets from:
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2017
Place all .XPT files into the data/ folder of your local checkout:

```
data/
├── DEMO_J.XPT
├── DIQ_J.XPT
├── BMX_J.XPT
└── GHB_J.XPT
```
These files are ignored by Git for privacy and size reasons.

🐳 Building the Docker Image
This project uses an M1/M2-compatible Docker image with RStudio Server.
From the project root:

```
docker build . -t nhanes-diabetes
```
